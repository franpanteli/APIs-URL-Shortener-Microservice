Running the project locally:

1. git clone https://github.com/franpanteli/APIs-URL-Shortener-Microservice-Project.git

2. cd into its local directory 

3. npm install
	-> This installs the npm dependencies 

3. node server.js 
	-> This runs the server - after this is run, the server should be listening to the 8080 port (or its backup port)
	-> The project is setup so that you can add in an environment variable called `PORT`- otherwise the 8080 port will be used 
		-> If you want to add in a different port, either change the server.js file, or add in a sample.env file using `touch sample.env` while you are cd'd into its local directory 

4. http://localhost:8080 
	-> Go to this URL in the browser (or to the relevant one, depending on the port being used)

First time: 
	-> cd into the repository 
	-> npm install 
	-> node server.js
	-> http://localhost:8080 in the browser 

Every other time:
	-> cd into the repository 
	-> node server.js
	-> In the browser 
		-> http://localhost:8080 <- this serves the project index.html file
